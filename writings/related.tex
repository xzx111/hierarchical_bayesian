\subsection{Recommender Systems}

With the explosive growth of digital information over the Internet, the recommender system is considered to be one of the most effective approaches to overcome such information overload. Traditional recommendation algorithms such as item-based approaches learn interactions between users and items and recommend items to users who share similar historical behaviors: collaborative filtering \cite{Sarwar:2001:ICF:371920.372071,Su:2009:SCF:1592474.1722966} and matrix factorization \cite{Rendle:2010:FPM} are both effective approaches under this category.  Content-based approaches including \cite{2011rsh..book...73L,Liu:2011,Yuan:2015} take use of the auxiliary information of both users and items in the content spaces to recommend similar items.  Furthermore, session based recommender systems are developed by analyzing user session information and user visiting patterns \cite{Gultekin_acollaborative,Tang_review:2013}. These particular recommendation techniques take time as an additional dimension, which aims at explicitly modeling user interests over time slices.  Koren \cite{Koren:2010} develops a collaborative filtering type of approach with predictions from static average values combining with a dynamic changing factor. Yin et.al. \cite{Yin:2011} proposes a user-tag-specific temporal interest model to track user interests over time by maximizing the time weighted data likelihood.  For better personalization, Guy et.al. \cite{Guy:2009} proposes an item-based recommender system to utilize each user's social network information. 

\subsection{Bayesian Approaches for Recommendation}

Recently, there are works using Bayesian inferencing for recommender systems.  Rendle et.al. \cite{rendle2009bpr} combines the Bayesian inference and matrix factorization together for learning users implicit feedbacks (click \& purchase) that is able to directly optimize ranking results. Ben-Elazar et.al. \cite{Ben-Elazar:2017} and Zhang et.al. \cite{zhang2007efficient} take user preference consistency into account and develop a variational Bayesian personalized ranking model for better music recommendation.  However, none of these approaches leverage the item structural information when learning each Bayesian models.  Given the fact that the hierarchical structural information widely exist in real-world recommendation scenarios such as e-commerce, social network, music, etc. failing to utilize such information typically makes the Bayesian approaches inefficient and ineffective.  

\subsection{Hierarchical Recommender Systems}

Hierarchical information for recommender systems, as mentioned, is a natural yet powerful entity structure that encodes human knowledge by means of tree based dependency constraints between entities defined by a group of hyper parameters. %and the corresponding hyper-parameters for recommender systems.  
Recommender system hierarchies, in particular, could be either explicit or implicit; either approximate or exact.  There are a few recommendation approaches take use of such information in order to promote items to users who have explicitly visited hierarchically related items or have shown preferences to items that belong to the same sub-categories.  In social tagging systems, Shepitsen et.al. \cite{shepitsen2008personalized} relies on the hierarchies generated by user-taggings, a.k.a folksonomies to build a better personalized recommender system.  In e-commerce, Wang et.al. \cite{wang2018exploring} introduces a hierarchical matrix factorization approach that exploits the intrinsic hierarchical information to alleviate cold start and data sparsity problems.  Despite the fact that these hierarchical recommender systems have received some success, there are still challenges such like: 1. how to infer the hierarchical structure efficiently and accurately if it is not completely explicit; 2. how to better understand the hierarchical topologies discovered by recommendation approaches; 3. how to utilize the hierarchical information for better data explanation all remain unsolved issues.

In this work, we focus on building a generic recommender system that combines the hierarchical structural information as well as the Bayesian inference to better tackle the recommendation problem.  Bayesian learning scheme takes account of both the user preferences and the entity hidden structural properties. It is able to recommend items that align to users' long term tastes.  Meanwhile, the learned latent variables can be well interpreted and explained, which grants us the capability to better analyze the user interests and preferences.
