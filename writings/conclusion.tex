In this paper, we propose a novel generalized learning framework that learns both the entity hierarchical structure and its latent factors for building a personalized Bayesian recommender system, \emph{HBayes}.  
By utilizing variational Bayesian inference approach, HBayes is able to converge efficiently with few iterations.  In empirical studies, we walk through a practical case study of e-commerce apparel data and another publicly available music recommendation data.  Experiment results show that HBayes beats other \emph{state-of-the-art} recommendation approaches in the sense of precisions, recalls, F1-score, as well as NDCG metrics, due to the fact that HBayes is able to extract the data characteristics as well as capture user hidden preferences.
