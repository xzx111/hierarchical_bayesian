In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian Personalized recommendation approach, \emph{HBayes}.  It simultanously leverages the hierarchical structural information and learns the Bayesian recommendation approach.   By walking through a practical case study of apparel e-commerce data and another public available music recommendation data, HBayes beats other \emph{state-of-the-art} recommendation approaches in the sense of precisions, recalls, F1-score, as well as NDCG metrics.
