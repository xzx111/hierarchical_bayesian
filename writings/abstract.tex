Items in modern recommender systems are often organized in hierarchical structures. These hierarchical structures and the data within them provide valuable information for building personalized recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a general hierarchical Bayesian learning framework, i.e., \emph{HBayes}, to learning both the structures and associated latent factors. Furthermore, we develop a variational inference algorithm that is able to learn model parameters with fast empirical convergence rate. The proposed HBayes is evaluated on two real-world datasets from different domains. The results demonstrate the benefits of our approach on item recommendation tasks, and show that it can outperform the state-of-the-art models in terms of both F1 measurement and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
